# Phaser WebStorm Template

This project is a simple set of starting files to get a Phaser game started using the WebStorm IDE for TypeScript editing, and Chrome DevTools for live debugging of TypeScript via sourcemaps.

### Notable Features

* TypeScript code-hinting, intellisense, error checking
* File watchers to generate .js and sourcemaps on save
* Require.js used for modular typescript (one class and/or module per file)
* Live debugging of modular TypeScript with Chrome DevTools (including breakpoints, watchers, etc...)

*For Best Results, Please use Webstorm 6 EAP ( >= build 129.541)*
